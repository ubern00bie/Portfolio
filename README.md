# Portfolio

For this assignment I was tasked to create a portfolio using bootstrap. 

On my index page (about me) I used the bootstrap grid system, a bootstrap NavBar, and a sticky footer from bootstrap. 

On my "contact" page I used the same NavBar, an accordian collapse which reveals my email or phone number, and a sticky footer from bootstrap.

On my "portfolio" page I used the same NavBar again and utilized the grid system's subheadings and subcolumns to organize my content. I then used the same sticky footer from bootstrap.
