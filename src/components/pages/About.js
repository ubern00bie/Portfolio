                  <h2>Hi, I'm Jordan. <br/>It's a pleasure to meet you.</h2>
                  <p> Iâ€™m a developer with experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java/Apex. 
                    I enjoy developing small apps and API integration. 
                    My previous career/education was in geology, where I gained skills in project management and public relations. 
                    I learned how to operate professionally in a corporate environment and how to work collaboratively to accomplish goals and meet deadlines. 
                    Being ambitious, I accepted every opportunity to challenge myself and accept additional responsibilities. 
                    I have been programming since middle school and have recently decided to pursue development as a career rather than a hobby. 
                    I am seeking a position in software engineering or web developer where I can learn and expand upon my knowledge. 
                  </p>
